* Create a submodule that creates http.Request objects using parameters.
  * Possible name: RequestBuilder
	* Exposes a method called Build(url, params)
	* url is the subresource, the RequestBuilder adds the preffix and suffix
	* params is another interface so that I can use local domain objects that know how
	  to convert themselves into HTTP parameters.

	type ParamsBuilder interface {
		Params() *url.Values
	}
